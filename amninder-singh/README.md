## 📌 Project Overview

Build a Magic 8 Ball fortune teller app with a graphical interface in Java! Users type a yes/no question, click the 8 ball, and get a mysterious random answer with a cool animation effect.

### How It Works:
1. User types a question ("Will I pass my exam?")
2. Clicks the Magic 8 Ball button
3. Ball "shakes" with animation
4. Random fortune appears ("It is certain", "Ask again later", "Don't count on it")

### Example Fortunes:
- ✅ Positive: "It is certain", "Yes definitely", "You may rely on it"
- 🤔 Neutral: "Ask again later", "Cannot predict now", "Concentrate and ask again"
- ❌ Negative: "Don't count on it", "My reply is no", "Very doubtful"
