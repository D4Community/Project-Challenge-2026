## 📌 Project Overview

Build an interactive website that changes its entire theme (colors, background, fonts) based on the mood/emoji the user selects. When a user clicks on an emoji (😊 😢 😠 😴 🎉), the whole page transforms to match that mood!

### Example:
- 😊 Happy → Bright yellow/orange theme
- 😢 Sad → Blue/grey theme
- 😠 Angry → Red/dark theme
- 😴 Sleepy → Purple/dark blue theme
- 🎉 Party → Colorful gradients
