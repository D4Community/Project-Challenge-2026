## 📌 Project Overview

Build a machine learning application that predicts whether a news headline/article is likely FAKE or REAL. Train a model on a fake news dataset and create a simple interface to test headlines.

### Features:
- Train a classifier on fake news dataset
- Predict if given text is fake or real
- Show confidence percentage
- Simple web interface or CLI to test

## ✅ Tasks

- [ ] Download a fake news dataset (Kaggle has good ones)
- [ ] Preprocess text data (lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.)
- [ ] Learn about TF-IDF vectorization for text
- [ ] Split data into training and testing sets
- [ ] Train a classifier (start with Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression)
- [ ] Evaluate model accuracy on test set
- [ ] Create a function to predict on new headlines
- [ ] Build a simple interface (Streamlit recommended, or CLI)
- [ ] Show prediction with confidence score
