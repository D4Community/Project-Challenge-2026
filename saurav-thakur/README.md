## 📌 Project Overview

Build an application where users can draw a digit (0-9) on a canvas, and an AI model predicts what digit they drew! Train a neural network on the MNIST dataset and connect it to a drawing interface.

### Features:
- Canvas to draw digits with mouse
- AI predicts the digit in real-time
- Show confidence for each digit (0-9)
- Clear canvas button
- Show prediction history

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

| You Already Know | You Will Learn |
|------------------|----------------|
| Python | TensorFlow/Keras basics |
| Basic AI/ML concepts | Neural Network architecture |
| C/C++ logic | Image preprocessing for ML |

## ✅ Tasks

- [ ] Learn basics of TensorFlow/Keras
- [ ] Load the MNIST dataset (built into Keras)
- [ ] Build a simple neural network (Dense layers)
- [ ] Train the model on MNIST data
- [ ] Save the trained model
- [ ] Create a web interface with HTML Canvas or use Streamlit
- [ ] Capture canvas drawing and preprocess (resize to 28x28, grayscale)
- [ ] Send preprocessed image to model for prediction
- [ ] Display predicted digit with confidence scores
- [ ] Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or HuggingFace Spaces

---

## 🌟 Bonus Challenges

- [ ] **+10 points:** Use CNN instead of Dense layers (better accuracy)
- [ ] **+5 points:** Show probability bar for all 10 digits
- [ ] **+10 points:** Add multiple digit recognition (draw multiple digits)
- [ ] **+5 points:** Add a "wrong prediction" feedback button
